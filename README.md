# dthemes
My collection of themes; this repository exists largely so that I can have
all of these in one place, but I will add some documentation here, too,
because that seems polite.

This heterogeneous collection of themes falls into three broad categories:

  1. themes I have created
  2. themes I have ported
  3. themes I have tweaked _slightly_ from their original forms (usually
     just to make comments more visible)

Themes I have created are licensed in the most permissive possible way.
Themes created by others are subject to their original licenses; I will
attempt to make these clear when possible.

The contents here are not really organized in any particular way, yet.
As this collection grows, this should change.

## Contents

`wesanderson/`

A set of themes I am generating based on the the collections of colors from
[this R package](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson) (which were
originally inspired by [this blog](https://wesandersonpalettes.tumblr.com/)).
The `wesanderson` R package is MIT licensed by
[@karthik](https://github.com/karthik).

`ports/`

Various themes made by other people that I have ported to editors that
I use/like.

`fixes/`

Tiny tweaks of other themes for my personal use.

`misc/`

Sui-generis themes.
