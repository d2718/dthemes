### Basalt

My port of 
[@RustingRobot's Basalt theme](https://github.com/RustingRobot/basalt-theme),
which is MIT licensed.

  * `basalt.toml` -- for Helix
  * `basalt.lua` -- for Lite XL
  * `basalt.conf` -- for Geany

### Sema Dark

My port of the dark versions of
[@lunacookies's sema family of themes](https://github.com/lunacookies/sema),
no apparent license. These are slightly different than the originals:

  1. I only did the dark themes because I only ever use dark themes.
  2. Comments are dimmer than the normal text and not italicized (obviously
     because I prefer it that way).
  3. There is _slightly_ more distinction in markup formatting.
  4. AFAICT, Helix (certainly Lite XL) can't by default tell whether a
     variable is mutable, so the cool mutability underlining you get
    with VSCode isn't there.

  * `sema.toml`, `sema_chroma.toml`, `sema_soft.toml`,
    `sema_chroma_soft.toml` -- for Helix
  * `sema.lua`, `sema_chroma.lua`, `sema_soft.lua`,
    `sema_chroma_soft.lua` -- for Lite XL. These are not particularly
    accurate; I like Lite XL, but its default set of scopes is pretty
    limited.

### Witch Hazel

My port of
[@theacodes's Witch Hazel themes](https://github.com/theacodes/witchhazel)
for editors I like. You can also find these files in her repository, which
is licensed Apache 2.0.

  * `witchhazel.toml`, `witchhazel_hyper.toml` -- for Helix
  * `witch_hazel.lua`, `witch_hazel_hypercolor.lua` -- for Lite XL
  * `witchhazel.conf` -- for Geany
