### Basalt

My port of 
[@RustingRobot's Basalt theme](https://github.com/RustingRobot/basalt-theme),
which is MIT licensed.

  * Helix: `basalt.toml`
  * Lite XL: `basalt.lua`
  * Geany: `basalt.conf`

### Sema Dark

My port of the dark versions of
[@lunacookies's sema family of themes](https://github.com/lunacookies/sema),
no apparent license. These are slightly different than the originals:

  1. I only did the dark themes because I only ever use dark themes.
  2. Comments are dimmer than the normal text and not italicized (obviously
     because I prefer it that way).
  3. There is _slightly_ more distinction in markup formatting.
  4. AFAICT, none of these other editors can by default tell whether a
     variable is mutable, so the cool mutability underlining you get
    with VSCode isn't there. These themes are _aesthetically_ similar, but
    not as functional.

  * Helix: `sema.toml`, `sema_chroma.toml`, `sema_soft.toml`,
    `sema_soft_chroma.toml`
  * Lite XL: `sema.lua`, `sema_chroma.lua`, `sema_soft.lua`,
    `sema_soft_chroma.lua`
  * Geany: `sema.conf`, `sema_chroma.conf`, `sema_soft.conf`,
    `sema_soft_chroma.conf`

### Witch Hazel

My port of
[@theacodes's Witch Hazel themes](https://github.com/theacodes/witchhazel)
for editors I like. You can also find these files in her repository, which
is licensed Apache 2.0.

  * Helix: `witchhazel.toml`, `witchhazel_hyper.toml`
  * Lite XL: `witch_hazel.lua`, `witch_hazel_hypercolor.lua`
  * Geany: `witchhazel.conf`, `witchhazel_hyper.conf`
